# Bella 4qt Air Fryer
#### By Luke Sakal, 2/25/2022

I had never really considered getting an air fryer before. It is a rare occasion that I actually fry something, so I never considered it a high priority. However, one day in the midst of one of my classes, a discussion broke out about air fryers â€” a discussion filled to the brim with praise. Following the wisdom of the crowd, I decided that I simply must try this magical device. With the help of a coupon and a holiday sale, I nabbed one for $25.

Plugging it in, I was greeted by a single button lighting up on the touch screen, which reads POWER/START.

Given this is the only button and it implies that it turns it on, I of course tap it. This brought me to a screen with multiple options.
Looking at the touch screen, one might already have some idea of how to use it.

The up and down arrows by the "temp" label increase and decrease the cooking temperature respectively. The same is true for the "time" label and its arrow buttons. These __natural mappings__ allow the user to quickly understand the relationship between the cooking options and the arrows. Tapping the MENU button will cycle through the different cooking presets visible at the top row. This time tapping the POWER/START button will, unsurprisingly, allow the appliance to start cooking.

There is also a good amount of __feedback__ when adjusting these options, which allows the user to see what their actions incur. For the temperature and time, one will see the numbers change as you tap the arrows, displaying on the screen the new time or temperature one has selected. When using the MENU option, the current selected preset will have its lights blink on and off and the temperature and time will show the defaults for that setting. The POWER/START option brings you to a new menu (if not powered on yet) and has some audio cues that indicate cooking has begun, such as a clicking noise and fans.

Thankfully, this product has decent __error tolerance__. Should one make a mistake on the temperature and time, they can adjust these settings at any point during the cooking process. The only issue comes when trying to turn the machine off before the cooking time has ended. I have not figured out if there is a way to shut it off via the menu. As such, I simply unplug it should I need too. While this is no issue for me, it could be problematic if the plug is somewhere hard to reach.

So far, I have had no issues with the __safety__ of this air fryer. By its very nature, it can cause harm if you touch it in the wrong place, much like a stove. However, none of the areas I've had to touch when using it have been anything more than warm.

Overall, I've found this air fryer to be remarkably __learnable__ and __effective__. I have not had to consult the manual to operate it and it has cooked things perfectly fine given the correct time and temperature are used. The __natural mappings__ and __feedback__ contribute to the __learnability__. Meanwhile, the __error tolerance__ and relative __safety__ take away any sense of anxiety that could arise during its use. 

With all this in mind, I agree with the rest of my class from that day. Definitely a worthwhile addition to the kitchen.
